## Description
This is a lightweight hand poser tool that simplifies creating animated hand poses for use in Unity XR applications.
Built using vanilla Unity colliders to handle interactions, no other framework is needed to use this package.


Grab interactions are included as well supporting both one and two-handed interactions. 
The framework is extendable, making it easy to add other types of interactions as needed.
